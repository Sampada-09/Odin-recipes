        <h2>Steps to Follow</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To a strainer, add flattened rice (poha). Rinse it under running water until it turns soft.</li>
            <li>To check if itâ€™s done, press a flake between your thumb and index finger, it should break easily.</li>
            <li>Add turmeric and 1/2 teaspoon salt to the poha and toss to combine. Set it aside while you make the tempering in the pan.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a pan on medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the mustard seeds and let them pop.</li>
            <li>Then add the peanuts and saute for a minute or two until they start turning brown.</li>
            <li>Then add the chopped onion, green chili and curry leaves. Cook for 2 minutes until the onions soften.</li>
            <li>Add the green peas (which had been soaked in warm water for 10 minutes prior) and mix. Cook for 2 minutes until raw smell of peas goes away.</li>
            <li>Then add in the rinsed poha and toss to combine. Taste test some poha and if it feels dry, sprinkle little water all over (I usually do that). Cook for 1-2 minutes.  Also tastes test and add more salt as needed at this point (I added around 1/8 teaspoon).</li>
            <li>Also add the sugar (if using) and cilantro.</li>
            <li>And then cover the pan with a lid and turn heat to low. Let it be like that for 2 minutes. Then turn off the heat.</li></ol>
